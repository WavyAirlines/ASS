        <h1 className="text-center">Professional Odyssey:</h1>
        <p>During my summers, I delved into the dynamic world of work, contributing to both Howa Canada and Walmart. These experiences not only equipped me with valuable skills in teamwork, customer service, and adaptability but also instilled in me a strong work ethic. Each role, whether at the assembly line or assisting customers at Walmart, has been a stepping stone in my professional growth.</p>
        <p>Currently navigating my final semester at Georgian College for Interactive Media Design, I've come a long way since high school graduation. My journey into the captivating realm of web design began at Humber College during my time pursuing marketing and advertising. A revelation struck me in a web design course where I scored a perfect 100%. Realizing my passion for UX/UI design, I decided to pivot my career path, a decision I've never looked back on.</p>
